title: "About Me"
---

I'm a software developer, problem solver and lifelong learner. I love open source technology, music and video games. I love things that that I have never done before.

## Career

I studied EE in Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. In my junior year, I found myself more interested in Computer Science, so I started learning different programming languages. I enjoy self-learning more than taking classes, and almost everything I know about CS was self-learned.

After graduation from BUPT, I got a job from **Sohu.com**, where I had a chance to get involved into the development of a very large-scaled system.

Over one-year work at Sohu.com, I decided to get myself a degree in CS. I came to USA to study a master's degree in Computer Science at Stevens Institute of Technology, and will pursue a career in this beautiful nation after graduation.

## Now

I live in Jersey City now. It has great weather, a peaceful community, [a good public transport system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoboken_Terminal) and is the best place I have ever lived.
