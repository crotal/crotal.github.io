These series of notes are based on the book [*Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective*](http://www.amazon.com/Computer-Systems-Programmers-Perspective-3rd/dp/013409266X/).

The homepage for the book is [http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/).

I put these notes here for me to review the book conveniently, hope it helps you as well.

## Information = Bits + Context

Files that consist exclusively of ASCII characters are known as *text files*. All other files are known as *binary files*.

The machine representations of numbers are not the same as integers and real numbers as they a finite approximations that can behave in unexpected ways.

### Why is C so successful?

- C was closely tied with the Unix opearting system. Most of the Unix kernel and all of its supporting tools and libraries were written in C.
- C is a small and simple language. The simplicity of C made it relatively easy to learn and to port to different computers.
- C was designed for a proctical purpose.

### However, C also have weaknesses:

- C pointers are a common source of confusion and programming errors.
- C lacks explicit support for some abstractions, such as classes, objects and exceptions and exceptions.

## The 4 phases of the Compilation System

- **Preprocessing phase**: The preprocessor(cpp) transform the source program, which is in a text form, into a modified source program form according to directives begin with the `#` character. The result is typically ends with the `.i` suffix.
- **Compilation phase**: The compiler(cc1) translates the `.i` file into a text file which contains an assembly-language program, which ends with the `.s` suffix.
- **Assembly phase**: The assembler(as) translates the assembly-language program into machine-language instructions, and packages them in a the *relocatable object program*, the output file is ended with the `.o` suffix.
- **Linking phase**: The linker(ld) handles a process which merges the source program (`.o` file) with other precompiled object file from other libraries. The result is the *executable object file*, which is ready to be loaded into memory and executed by the system.

## Understanding How Compilation System Work is useful

- **Optimizing program performance**: With the basic understanding of machine-level code and how to compiler translates different C statements into machine code, we can make good coding decisions in our C programs.
- **Understanding link-time errors**: Some of the most perplexing programming errors are related to the operation of the linker.
- **Avoiding security holes**: With better understanding of how compilation system works, we may reduce the threat of our program being attacked.

## Processors Read and Interpret Instructions

### Hardware Organization of a System

- **Buses**: Buses is a collection of electrical conduits running throughout the system. Buses are typically designed to transfer *Ts*. 32 bits machines have word size of 4 bytes and 64 bits machine have word size of 8 bytes.
- **I/O Devices**: Input/Output devices, such as keyboards, mouses, monitors and hard drive disks, are the system's connection to the external world. Each I/O Device is connected to the I/O bus by either a *controller* or an *adaper*.
- **Main Memory**: The main memory holds both a program and data it manipulates, physically consists of *dynamic random access memory*(DRAM) chips and logically organized as a linear array of bytes.
- **Processor**: CPU, also called *processor*, is an engine which interprets(executes) instructions stored in main memory, consists of *the program counter*(PC), the *arithmetic/logic unit*(ALU) and *register file*. The CPU can carry out a few operations, such as *Load*, *Store*, *Operate* and *Jump*.

### Running a Program

When we run a executable file(in Shell for example), shell loads the executable file to the main memory using *DMA*, and processor begin to execute the machine-language instuctions in the executable file's main routine.

*Direct Memory Access*(DMA) is a technique to transfer data directly from disk to main memory, no need to go through the processor.

### Caches

System spends a lot of time moving information from one place to another, so it is important to make the information move faster.

Cache memories, designed to deal with the `processor-memory gap`, were small fast storage devices to store temproary information which the processor is likely to need in the near future.

- *L1 cache* is nearly as fast as the register file.
- *L2 cache* is about 5 times slower than *L1 cache*, but is still 5 to 10 times faster than the main memory.
- Both *L1 cache* and *L2 cache* are implemented with *static random access memory*(SRAM).

### Storage Devices Form a Hierarchy

- Storage at one level serves as a cache for storage at the next lower level.
- The higher the level of the storage device, the faster and smaller it can be.
- The storage device on the top of the Hierarchy is the register file.
- Local disks can be the cache of the remote storage.(Like information on the web server.)

### The Operating System Manages the Hardware

The operating system has two primary purpose:

1. To protect the hardware from misuse by runaway applications.
2. To provide applications with simple and uniform mechanisms for manipulating complicated and often wildly different low-level hardware devices.

### Processes

- A *process* is the operating system's absctraction of a running program.
- When we run a program on a modern operating system, processes provides an **illusion** that the program is the only one running on the system, and the program appears to have exclusive use of the processor, main memory and the I/O devices.
- Multiple processes can run **concurrently** on the same system. When running concurrently, the instructions of one process are interleaved with the instructions of another process.
- The operating system performs this interleaving with **context switching**.
- *Context* is also known as *state*, which includes information such as the current value of PC, the register file, and the content of main memory.

### Threads

- *Threads* are execution units which processes in modern systems have.
- Each of the threads in a process runs in the context of the process and sharing the same code and global data.
- Sharing data between threads is easier than sharing data between processes.

### Virtual Memory

- *Virtual memory* is an abstraction that provides each process with the illusion that it has exclusive use of the main memory.
- Each process has the same uniform view of memory, which is known as its *virtual address space*.

### Files

- A *file* is a sequence of *bytes*.
- Every I/O device is modeled as a file.
- Using a small set of system calls known as *Unix I/O*, all input/output in the system is performed by reading and writing files.

### Systems Communicate with Each Other Using Networks

The network can also be viewed as an I/O device.

### Concurrency and Parallelism

- *Concurrency* to refer to the general concept of a system with multiple, simultaneous activities.
- *Parallelism* to refer to the use of concurrency to make a system run faster.

Parallelism can be exploited at multiple levels of abstraction in a computer system, for example there are **Thread-Level Concurrency**, **Instruction-Level Parallelism**, and **Single-Instruction, Multiple-Data (SIMD) Parallelism**.
