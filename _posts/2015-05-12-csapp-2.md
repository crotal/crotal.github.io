These series of notes are based on the book [*Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective*](http://www.amazon.com/Computer-Systems-Programmers-Perspective-3rd/dp/013409266X/).

The homepage for the book is [http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/).

I put these notes here for me to review the book conveniently, hope it helps you as well.

## Imformation Storage

### Bytes

- *Byte* is the smallest addressable unit of memory.
- Every byte of memory is identified by a unique number(*address*).
- All possible addresses form the *virtual address space*.

### Words

- *Word size* indicates the nominal size of integer and pointer data.
- For a machine with a $w$-bit word size, the virtual memory addresses can range from $0$ to $2^w-1$.

### Data Sizes

This chart shows sizes of C numeric data types of 32-bit and 64-bit machines.

C declaration | 32-bit        | 64-bit
------------- | ------------- | ---
char          |       1       |  1
short int     |       2       |  2
int           |       4       |  4
long int      |       4       |  8
long long int |       8       |  8
char *        |       4       |  8
float         |       4       |  4
double        |       8       |  8

### Strings

- A string in C is encoded by an array of characters terminated by the null character(`\0`).

### Boolean Algebra

- Claude Shannon was the first to made the connection between Boolean algebra and digital logic.
- ** Opeartions: ** **NOT**, **AND**, **OR** and **EXCLUSIVE-OR**.

### Integer representations

To represent positive-only values(unsigned numbers), we use **unsigned encodings**. To represent both positive and negative values(signed numbers), we use **two's complement encodings**.

- **U**: Unisigned Encodings
- **T**: Two's Complement Encodings

Remember:

- $ U_{Max} = 2^w - 1 $
- $ T_{Max} = 2^{w-1} - 1 $
- $ T_{Min} = 2^{w-1} $

### Conversions Between Signed and Unsigend

For conversions between signed and unsigned numbers with the same word size: **the numeric values might change, but the bit patterns do not**.

When executing an operation between an unsigned operand and a signed operand, C will convert the signed operand to an unsigned operand implicitly.

For conversion from signed integer to unsigned integer:

$$  T2U_w\left(x\right) =
\begin{cases}
x+2^w,  & x < 0 \\\\
x, & x \ge 0
\end{cases}$$

For conversion from unsigned integer to signed integer:

$$ U2T_w\left(u\right) =
\begin{cases}
-2^w + u, & u \ge 2^{w-1} \\\\
u, & u < 2^{w - 1}
\end{cases}$$

### Expanding the Bit Representation of a Number

- **Zero Extension**: To expand a unsigned number, we simply add leading zeros to the representation.
- **Sign Extension**: To expand a two's complement number, we add copies of the most significant bit to the representation.

### Truncating Numbers

To truncate an unsigned number:

$$
B2U_k\left(\left[x_{k-1}, x_{k-2}, ..., x_0\right]\right)
= B2U_w\left(\left[x_{w-1}, x_{w-2}, ..., x_0\right]\right) \text{mod} ~ 2^k
$$

To truncate an two's complement number:

$$
B2T_k\left(\left[x_{k-1}, x_{k-2}, ..., x_0\right]\right)
= U2T_k\left(B2U_w\left(\left[x_{w-1}, x_{w-2}, ..., x_0\right]\right) \text{mod} ~ 2^k\right)
$$

### Floating Point

The numerical form of floating point numbers is $ V_{10} = \left(-1\right)^s \cdot M \cdot 2^E $.

- Sign bit **s** determines whether the number is positive or negative.
- **M** is a fractional value in range $ \left[1.0, 2.0\right] $
- **E** weights value by a power of 2.

**Floating point in memory**:

- Single precision(32 bits): 1 sign bit, 8 exponent bits and 23 fraction bits.
- Double precision(64 bits): 1 sign bit, 11 exponent bits and 52 fraction bits.

exponent bits encodes E, fraction bits encodes M.

**Special values**:

- When exp bits are all 1 and frac bits are all 0, the number represents $ \infty $ ($+\infty$ when $ s=0$ and $-\infty$ when $s=1$).
- When exp bits are all 1 and frac bits are not all 0, the number represents $NaN$(Not a Number).

**Encoding**:

- Exponent was coded as biased values: $ E = exp - Bias $.
- Significand coded with implied leading 1: $ M = 1.xxx...x$.

**Example**:

    float f = 12345.0;

$ 12345_{10} = 1.1000000111001_2 \cdot 2^{13} $

Significand:

- $ M = 1000000111001_2$.
- $ frac = 10000001110010000000000_2$.

Exponent:

- $ E = 13 $
- $ Bias = 127$
- $ exp = E + Bias = 140 = 10001100_2 $

Result:

sign bit  | exp           | frac
--------- | ------------- | ---
0         | 10001100      |  10000001110010000000000
