Recently I shut down my weblog, thinking about how to write articles with more influence. Then I decided to start a brand new blog, and this time I write articles only in English.

For years I've been blogging in Chinese, which developed me a bad habit: Always want to translate some nice stuff from English to Chinese, and rarely write something on my own. Due to this, I decided to start a English weblog where I write only original articles.

Besides, I write stuff for improving my English, English is the working language of the hacker culture and the Internet, for better take part in technical discussions, I must improve my fluency in English.

I will share my ideas and thoughts, continue writing interesting stuff here.

So this is the fresh start.
